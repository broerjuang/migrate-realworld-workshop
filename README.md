# Migrate Realworld Workshop

The original [react-redux-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app) has been squashed into a single commit to streamline this workshop. We don't mean to discredit any contributors so please check the original project for the previous commit history.

The original project uses the standard `npm install` and `npm start` commands for installing dependencies and running application.
